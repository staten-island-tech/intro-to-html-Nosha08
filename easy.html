    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Noah Rozin</h2>
    <p>The year is 2023. I am surrounded by interesting students, including Evan Yegorov: the mastermind, Gabriel Liberov: the ginger, and Izak Zoltan: the person who just learned about the existence of Trickle Down Economics. What is this unique environment? AP Computer Science Principles, the class most notorious for students getting 1s and wishing they just stuck with HTML.</p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com">What is this?</a>

    <h2>This is crazy!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Evan being in this class</li>
        <li>Second element because I don't know what to put</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>This is even crazier!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Evan forgetting to use Python that one time</li>
        <li>Not sure what to put. I just want to do JS already</li>
    </ul>
